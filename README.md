For best experience, please import this project in an IDE such as Intellij or Eclipse.

Please note I could only dedicate around 3 hours to this project so only the basic test cases 
were implemented. But I figured, this would give you an idea of how I would implement the rest
of the scenarios.

If I had more time, I could write at-least 50 more scenarios especially negative API based tests.

I also took some shortcuts while doing assertions and added appropriate comments in the code to 
save time.

I've included a sample html report "Test Results - RunTest.html" in the parent folder which was 
generated by Intellij using the Gradle/JUnit/Cucumber plugin. You can export to HTML after a test run
to regenerate locally as necessary.

For e.g. to execute all tests in org.bullish package, run the following Gradle task
:test --tests "org.bullish.RunTest"
Alternatively, you can right-click on RunTest Java class and hit run.

You can find the 2 basic Selenium tests in org.selenium package.

Please feel free to reach out if you have any questions. Sorry I couldn't dedicate more time.
